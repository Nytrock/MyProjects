# Introduction
For the normal recording of all my progress in the development of various projects and the growth of me as a programmer, this repository was created. It contains brief information and links to the repositories of all projects that I have ever done. All projects are arranged in chronological order relative to the start of work on them, this repository will be updated periodically.

# List of projects
## [Madness cooking](https://github.com/Nytrock/Madness_Cooking_EN)
- Status: ⬆ Update is possible
- Date of creation: Summer 2021
- Description: My first game on Unity and therefore the first big project. It is a mixture of a farming simulator and a cafe simulator, made in the style of pixel art. Initially, the project was supposed to also include a platformer genre with RPG elements, but due to tight deadlines and unprofessionalism, this was cut out. As a test of the pen, it will do
- Plans: The game still has a lot of bugs and untapped potential and I want to update the game someday

## [Portal Dimensions](https://github.com/Nytrock/Portal_Dimensions)
- Status: ⏳ Under development
- Date of creation: September 2021 - today's time

## [Virtual school](https://github.com/Nytrock/Lyceum_PyQT5_Project)
- Status: ✅ Completed
- Date of creation: November 2021
- Description: The first project created for Yandex.Lyceum. It was developed in Python using the PyQt5 library. It is a local application for Windows that parodies electronic diaries. The project was created to study the functionality of the PyQt5 library and is not of practical use
- Plans: I am not going to change my projects for Yandex.Lyceum in any way, not counting the structure. The app will stay that way forever

## [Tetris](https://github.com/Nytrock/Lyceum_Pygame_Project)
- Status: ✅ Completed
- Date of creation: December 2021 - January 2022
- Description: Already the second project created for Yandex.Lyceum, this time was created in a team. In fact, there was no team, I did almost all the work myself. The project itself is a Tetris built with Pygame. Do not add, do not subtract, just classic Tetris
- Plans: I am not going to change my projects for Yandex.Lyceum in any case, not counting the structure. The app will stay that way forever

## [Personal page](https://github.com/Nytrock/Lyceum_Plus_Plus_Start_Project)
- Status: ✅ Completed
- Date of creation: February 2022
- Description: A site created as a creative project for admission to Yandex.Lyceum++ (now called "Yandex Academy Intensives") in the "Development on Django" direction. Created in a week of hard work. As a result, I got almost the maximum score for it and passed the selection
- Plans: I want to leave the site in the form in which I submitted it for verification

## [Newgramm](https://github.com/Nytrock/Lyceum_Plus_Plus_Start_Project)

## [NotYandex engine](https://github.com/Nytrock/not_yandex-engine)
- Status: ✅ Completed
- Date of creation: April 18-20, 2022
- Description: A search engine created in just 3 days in the process of participating in the VI Open IT Championship. There were three of us in the team: me, [Danila Yashin](https://github.com/zibestr) and [Maxim Pinzhura](https://github.com/MrProperixaOriginal). Each of us contributed to the creation of the project. I did frontend. As a result, we became winners in our category (by the way, it was the most difficult one offered at the beginning)
- Plans: Obviously, the very essence of the project lies in the shortness of the time frame for its creation, so there should not be any updates after those three days

# Introduction
For the normal recording of all my progress in the development of various projects and the growth of me as a programmer, this repository was created. It contains brief information and links to the repositories of all projects that I have ever done. All projects are in chronological order, and this repository will be updated periodically.

# An example of a project description
## Project name (link to the project repository)
- Status: There are several types of project statuses:
1. ✅ Completed - the project is completely finished and brought to a logical point, there will be no updates
1. ⬆ Update is possible - the project is completely finished, but there are ideas for possible updates
1. ⏳ Under development - the project is being developed at the moment
1. ⏸ On pause - the project is not fully completed, but for some reason work on it is not being carried out
1. ❌ Closed - the project is abandoned halfway through and there are no plans to return to it (highly undesirable status)
- Year of creation: in what year the project was created
- Description: a brief description of the essence of the project
- Addendum: addition to the status of the project, for example, why it was abandoned

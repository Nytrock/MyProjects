# Introduction
For the normal recording of all my progress in the development of various projects and the growth of me as a programmer, this repository was created. It contains brief information and links to the repositories of all projects that I have ever done. All projects are divided into categories and arranged in chronological order relative to the start of work on them, this repository will be updated periodically. I also have repositories with lists of [books read](https://github.com/Nytrock/Books) and [courses taken](https://github.com/Nytrock/Courses).

# An example of a project description
## Project name (link to the project repository)
- Status: There are several types of project statuses:
1. ✅ Completed - the project is completely finished and brought to a logical point, there will be no updates
1. ⬆ Update is possible - the project is completed, but there are ideas for possible updates
1. ⏳ Under development - the project is being developed at the moment
1. ⏸ On pause - the project is incomplete, but for some reason, work on it is not being carried out
1. ❌ Closed - the project is abandoned halfway through and there are no plans to return to it (highly undesirable status)
- Date of creation: when the project was created (Does not include the development period of the project as many of them I do intermittently)
- Description: a brief description of the essence of the project
- Plans: what do I plan to do with this project

# Games
Main activity

## [Madness cooking](https://github.com/Nytrock/MadnessCooking)
- Status: ⬆ Update is possible
- Date of creation: January 2024
- Description: Game that combines cafe, kitchen, and farm simulators with crazy humor and charming pixel art. Get ready for well-thought-out mechanics, hundreds of customers, dozens of dishes and upgrades (and just as many puns!). Grow your cafe to gain recognition in this bizarre world and maybe even... take it over? WHAT?!
- Plans: Release a couple of small updates

## [Portal Dimensions](https://github.com/Nytrock/PortalDimensions)
- Status: ❌ Closed
- Date of creation: September 2021
- Description: My second game is based on teleport mechanics in a 2D perspective. Basically, it's almost like Portal, but in 2D and from a third-person view. The genre is a 2D puzzle-platformer with pixel art. The game will feature interesting characters, engaging puzzles, great visuals, and plenty of side mechanics to keep you entertained
- Plans: The game was canceled due to overly ambitious goals


# Secondary projects
Small projects created for fun or for my needs

## [Image in image](https://github.com/Nytrock/ImageInImage)
- Status: ✅ Completed
- Date of creation: September 2022
- Description: A program that allows you to create images from ordinary, boring images, consisting of thousands of other images. What for? I don't know, sounds and looks pretty cool, and there is minimal customization, so it's still a good project
- Plans: This app is a joke, there will be no updates

## [Video in video](https://github.com/Nytrock/VideoInVideo)
- Status: ✅ Completed
- Date of creation: September 2022
- Description: Okay, yes, this project has evolved from the previous project and allows you to create videos that consist of videos. Sounds even crazier than pictures of pictures, I get it. True, due to the limited capabilities of most devices (and for the sake of optimization), the result does not look so impressive without a strong reduction in the quality of the original video. But this is still an interesting example of the work of human imagination and available technologies
- Plans: This app is a joke, there will be no updates

## [VOB to mp4](https://github.com/Nytrock/Vob_To_Mp4)
- Status: ⬆ Update is possible
- Date of creation: September 2022
- Description: A simple converter from the VOB format used for DVD videos to the more modern mp4 format. It is possible to convert multiple videos in one run of the program. The program itself was created out of personal necessity due to the lack of normal free alternatives
- Plans: Make a website so that the program becomes more popular and useful for other people, however, since my knowledge in creating websites is still very limited, there will be no such update in the near future

## [Vk to Telegram reposter](https://github.com/Nytrock/VkToTelegramReposter)
- Status: ⬆ Update is possible
- Date of creation: November 2023
- Description: A program that allows you to constantly send new posts from the public to a channel in Telegram. It was created due to the reluctance to use ready-made bots due to their slowness and due to the need to write a scientific article for the university
- Plans: Make a couple of small improvements for convenience
